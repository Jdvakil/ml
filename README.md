## Intro to Machine Learning
 
- ML is the process of *training* a piece of software, called a *model*, to make useful predictions from data.

+ **Training**: The process of determining the ideal parameters (weight and bias) comprising a model. DUring training, the system reads in examples and gradually adjusts parameters. 
+ **Model**: A mathematical contruct that processes input data and returns output. Or, a model is a set of parameters and structure needed for a system to make predictions. 
    + A linear regression model consists of a set of weights (A value that a model multiplies by another value) and biases
    + A neural network model consists of:
        * A set of hidden layers, each containing neurons
        * The W and B associated with each neuron.
    + A decision tree model 
        * The shape of the tree
        * The condition and leaves
